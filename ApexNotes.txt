1. To access sharing programmatically, you must use the share object associated with the standard or custom object for which you want
to share. For example, AccountShare is the sharing object for the Account object, ContactShare is the sharing object for the Contact
object. In addition, all custom object sharing objects are named as follows, where MyCustomObject is the name of the custom
object:
MyCustomObject__Share
Objects on the detail side of a master-detail relationship do not have an associated sharing object. The detail record’s access is determined
by the master’s sharing object and the relationship’s sharing setting.
2. StandardSetController: StandardSetController objects allow you to create list controllers similar to, or as extensions of, the pre-built Visualforce list
controllers provided by Salesforce. Helps in mass update and pagination.
3. For private methods in the Apex Class, add 'TestVisible' attribute to the Apex methods to access these methods in the test class.
